# Urban-Slum-Extraction-From-High-Resolution-Satellite-Data-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Network

An integrated approach to identify slumâ€™s degree of deprivation in terms of socio-economic variability using image features 
derived from very high resolution (VHR) satellite images

The CNN is trained to learn the discriminative spatial-contextual features and then semantically segmented to classify
the urban slum from other regions using MATLAB
 
Incorporated a hierarchal stack of convolutional and max pooling layers combined with a large training data set to achieve
an overall accuracy of 84.75%
